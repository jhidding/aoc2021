# Advent of Code 2021: my solutions in Haskell
This year I will publish my solutions for Advent of Code in Haskell, using Entangled to do **Literate Programming**.

## Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) is an anual coding challenge keeping nerds off the street for the entire merry month of decemeber. This is officially the best way to learn a new programming language or improve on your existing skills.

## Entangled
[Entangled](https://entangled.github.io) is a tool for Literate Programming. My challenge for this years' Advent of Code is to create a set of beautifull solutions, that are completely documented in a literate form. The idea is that the code you see here is the complete solution to a problem. Think of Entangled as a content-management system for code blocks in your Markdown documents. The code blocks are assembled into compilable code, while changes are also tracked back to your markdown files. This means you can still debug and work with your favourite IDE.

## Instructions
To run this code, I recommend installing Haskell using the [GHCUp installer](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/). Run all solutions:

```bash
cabal run x2021 -- -a
```
