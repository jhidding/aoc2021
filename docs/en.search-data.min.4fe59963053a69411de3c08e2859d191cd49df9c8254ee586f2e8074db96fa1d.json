This is officially the best way to learn a new programming language or improve on your existing skills.\n Spoiler warning #  If you\u0026rsquo;re still trying to solve AOC2021, this site contains spoilers.\n Entangled #  Entangled is a tool for Literate Programming. My challenge for this years' Advent of Code is to create a set of beautifull solutions, that are completely documented in a literate form. The idea is that the code you see here is the complete solution to a problem. Think of Entangled as a content-management system for code blocks in your Markdown documents. The code blocks are assembled into compilable code, while changes are also tracked back to your markdown files. This means you can still debug and work with your favourite IDE.\nInstructions #  To run this code, I recommend installing Haskell using the GHCUp installer. Run all solutions:\ncabal run x2021 -- -a License #  This code is licensed under the Apache v2 license, see LICENSE file in this repository.\n"}]
